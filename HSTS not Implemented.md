Here is an example of a Java code that does not set an HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header, leaving it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks:

## ðŸ¥º Vulnerable Code
```java
import java.io.*;
import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.*;

public class NoHSTSVulnerable extends HttpServlet { 
protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException { 
// Generate response 
PrintWriter out = response.getWriter(); 
out.println("<html><body>"); 
out.println("This is Sample Text"); 
out.println("</body></html>"); } }
```
This code is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks because it does not set an HSTS header, which tells the browser to only access the site using HTTPS. Without HSTS, an attacker could intercept the victimâ€™s request and redirect them to a malicious site, potentially leading to sensitive information being compromised.

## ðŸ˜Ž Secure Code
Here is a version of the same code that sets an HSTS header in a secure way:
```java

import java.io.*;
import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.*;

public class NoHSTSSecure extends HttpServlet {
protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
// Secure code: The application sets an HSTS header to enforce HTTPS for the specified duration
response.setHeader("Strict-Transport-Security", "max-age=31536000");

// Generate response
PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
out.println("<html><body>");
out.println("This page sets an HTTP Strict Transport Security header to enforce HTTPS for 1 year.");
out.println("</body></html>");
}
}
```
This version of the code sets an HSTS header with a max-age of 1 year, telling the browser to only access the site using HTTPS for the specified duration. This helps to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks by ensuring that the connection to the site is always encrypted.
